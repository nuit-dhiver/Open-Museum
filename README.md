# Open Museum

Open Museum is a bilingual (English/German) static website for exploring 3D reconstructions of monuments, fountains, and public art. The project documents cultural heritage through interactive 3D presentation at [openmuseum.io](https://openmuseum.io).

## Project Goals

The primary aim is to document and preserve 3D models of cultural and artistic heritage in public spaces. By leveraging modern photogrammetry and 3D reconstruction, we make these works accessible for online viewing and cultural documentation.

## Explore the Models

All works are available on the website for interactive viewing in the browser:

- **Browse models**: Visit [openmuseum.io](https://openmuseum.io)
- Models are served as `.glb` (web) and `.usdz` (Apple AR) where available
- Most works are **view-only** on the website; downloads are offered only for selected works where rights allow (see [License](#license))

Each work page shows its IP status (public domain, freedom of panorama, or authorized use) and whether downloads are available.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | [Astro](https://astro.build/) v6 (static output) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| 3D viewer | [`<model-viewer>`](https://modelviewer.dev/) v4 |
| Content | JSON content collection (`src/content/works/`) |
| i18n | Astro built-in routing — English at `/`, German under `/de/` |
| Deployment | GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions |

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root for optional configuration (see [Asset Storage](#asset-storage)).

## Asset Storage

Large files (3D models and images) are hosted on external storage to keep the repository lightweight.

The storage URL is configured via the `PUBLIC_ASSETS_BASE_URL` environment variable:

```bash
# .env
PUBLIC_ASSETS_BASE_URL=https://open-museum-885a1.firebasestorage.app
```

Asset paths in content JSON are resolved at build/runtime via [`src/utils/assets.ts`](src/utils/assets.ts).

### Modes

- **With remote assets**: Set `PUBLIC_ASSETS_BASE_URL` in `.env` and assets load from Firebase (or another compatible host)
- **With local assets**: Leave `PUBLIC_ASSETS_BASE_URL` empty and place asset files in `public/models/` and `public/images/works/` (these directories are gitignored)
- **Switching providers**: Change the base URL — path resolution is handled centrally in `getAssetUrl()`

### Firebase (authenticated model loading)

When Firebase is configured, model files can be loaded through authenticated requests. Set these in `.env` (or as GitHub Actions variables for deployment):

- `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

## Content

Each work is defined in `src/content/works/{slug}.json`. Key fields include:

- `title`, `description` — bilingual (`de` / `en`)
- `category` — `brunnen`, `denkmal`, or `kunstwerk`
- `model.glb`, `model.usdz` — asset paths
- `photos`, `poster` — gallery and preview images
- `location` — coordinates, address, optional Google My Maps embed URL
- `city`, `country`, `artist`, `modelCreator`, `year`, `material` — metadata
- `ipStatus` — `public-domain`, `freedom-of-panorama`, or `authorized-use`
- `downloadAllowed` — whether GLB/USDZ download is offered on the work page
- `tour` — optional guided camera tour steps

See [`src/content.config.ts`](src/content.config.ts) for the full schema.

## Gallery Thumbnails (Build-Time Optimization)

Work-page gallery images use generated `.webp` thumbnails for initial render and load the full-size photo only when the user opens the lightbox.

- Generator script: `pnpm thumbs:generate`
- Script source: `scripts/generate-work-photo-thumbnails.mjs`
- Auto-run before build: `prebuild` runs the generator automatically
- Output directory: `public/images/thumbnails/works/`

The generator reads all `photos` arrays from `src/content/works/*.json` (gallery photos only), then:

- fetches originals from `PUBLIC_ASSETS_BASE_URL` when set (Firebase-compatible URL handling), or
- reads originals from local `public/` when external storage is not configured.

Optional tuning via environment variables:

- `WORK_THUMBNAIL_WIDTH` (default: `900`)
- `WORK_THUMBNAIL_QUALITY` (default: `72`)
- `WORK_THUMBNAIL_CONCURRENCY` (default: `4`)

## CI Asset Health Check

The deployment workflow includes an automated changed-page asset validation step:

- Command: `pnpm test:assets:changed`
- Script: `scripts/ci/asset-health-check.mjs`
- Scope: validates only pages affected by changed content/routes in the current deployment diff
- Checks:
  - poster assets (e.g. `<model-viewer poster>` and `og:image`)
  - photo assets (`<img src>`)
  - 3D model sources (`<model-viewer src>` and `ios-src`)

If validation fails, the workflow:

- fails the build before deployment,
- emits GitHub Actions error annotations per failed asset,
- uploads `asset-health-report.md` as a workflow artifact,
- writes the same report to the workflow step summary for quick triage.
